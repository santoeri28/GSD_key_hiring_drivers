       "[\"Communication needs for adequate and proper ways of communication in general. In addition, the reduced communication frequency with the project team members became a problem due to the need for more informal or face-to-face contact. Each culture has its standards, styles, and moral principles, which can provoke communication related issues when individual belonging from different cultural background communicates with another one. Temporal issues are related to the time difference between teams that work Delayed feedback and responses are problematic and restrict the possibility of synchronous interaction, cooperation, and confidential assessment. Loss of tacit knowledge due to replacement of onshore with offshore staff. Reduced opportunities for synchronous communication were also a significant risk factor in GSD. Has the team met or talked personally? This event grows the relationship between people at different sites, increasing the efficient outsourcing relationships in organizational management. Due to the temporal distance, the use of synchronous communication becomes less. In general, limited face-to-face meetings can decrease the opportunity for informal interaction, leading to a lack of team awareness and cohesiveness. However, it can be very costly and time-taking to travel frequently to a remote location. Technical incompatibilities among distributed sites cause an obstacle in communication due to technological issues. Quality of communication tools and network speed between sites. The low quality of telecommunication bandwidth is a communication issue because the context, tone, and emotion could be disoriented. Information Management is critical due to sharing relevant information between team members. The delay in getting a response can expand the time needed to resolve the issues. Lack of interpersonal relationship originates due to geographical distance among globally distributed teams. Fear's impact can manifest itself in numerous ways, including the desire to prevent or limit communication with remote colleagues. In some instances, the objective can be to hinder the work of these remote colleagues directly. Socio-culture distance. Less overlapping working hours increase the possibility of using asynchrony communication, as the overlapping working hours is the only time synchrony communication is feasible. Since virtual teams rely on electronic communication, any internet downtime could isolate team members and halt workflow. Degree of communication concreteness is a manner element of communication conveyed by perceptible, precise, or specific terms. Working and workplace atmosphere. Effort to initiate contact. Use of English for communication. \",\n",
       " \"A project's success or failure depends on the accuracy and effective management of requirements. Build quality comprises the risk variables, requirements analysis, design, and construction. Therefore, the project manager must be diligent in formulating and adopting appropriate quality processes, procedures, tools, templates, techniques, guidelines, and standards. Clear software requirements are compulsory for the quality product, and it changes till the completion of software development and that gradually changes create new challenges to deal with. Stakeholder Requirements, or user requirements, describe what users do with the system, such as the activities that users must be able to perform. Usually, we use narrative text, use cases, scenarios, user stories, or event-response tables to document it. Failures to meet customer requirements and expectations are often related to misunderstanding, and misconception. Involving end users during system development is paramount to ensuring project success. Customers usually show little involvement while discussing the requirements in detail during the development process, which may lead to a weak relationship between the developer and the customer. Requirements engineering meeting’s needs: engaging a human facilitator and using rich communication media that supports data, videos, and audio integration; preparing agenda and following it; selecting relevant participants and informing them of times to participate in requirement meetings; timely exchanging supporting documents to give participants enough time to read the relevant material; enabling participants of requirements meetings to access the resources that contain information about the requirements. The high degree of requirements changes during the project may provoke significant delays, with a good chance of introducing errors and misunderstandings. Project methodology (approach, mentoring). Software quality control. Site characteristics, including analyst capability, programmer capability, language and tool experience, personnel continuity, and customer proximity, are variable factors in the task allocation decision. The main characteristics of the project are defined by the way the work groups are organized, the project manager's level of authority; the level of dedication of the project manager; the availability of resources; who manages the budget; level of dedication of project management administrative staff.  Estimation and planning are related topics, but estimation is not planning, and planning is not estimation. Therefore, estimation should be treated as an unbiased, analytical process, and planning should be treated as a tiny, goal-seeking process. \",\n",
       " \"Project management performance questions: extent and frequency of plan changes; frequency of emergency meetings; agreement between effort invested and effort required; participant satisfaction; customer satisfaction; the number of post-delivery product changes. Skilled leadership that has the expertise to assess and analyze the impact of demanded changes and will make the right decision at the right time. There are project failure micro and macro-risk elements. Micro-risks can often be correctly determined, and alternative strategies put in place to mitigate their potential impact. Macro-risks on the other hand may not even be considered. Lack of ICT and technological cohesion. The firm’s retained earnings mainly determine budget constraints, the net present value of its future investments, the quality of its management, and the liquidation value of its assets are other examples. Financial maturity is when a stand's anticipated future value growth will not increase the firm's net worth. Labor cost is the leading reason organizations go global, but the availability of human resources is more important than cost. Practitioners sometimes require support to have personal availability. The team experience evolves different project background issues arise due to the difference in working culture when developers from different countries need to work on a project that is not like the existing project background. Time pressure on people working on the project results in developers attempting to find shortcuts and adopt different approaches to complete software development to accomplish the given deadline. Lack of human resources, knowledge, and skills. Lack of suitable infrastructure for integration and the nonavailability of skilled human resources to solve integration issues in time hinder the integration process. Project instability manifests itself as changing team structures, responsibilities between sites, personnel changes, and roles of existing personnel. Human related problems. Turnover (team/staff). Conflict management could be divided into affective and substantive conflict. Overloading of key personnel. Handling stress. We can better comprehend stress by exploring the circumstances or context (i.e., occupational, or personal) surrounding the events. Flexibility. Handling soft issues. It is a behavioral characteristic comprised of misaligned interests, lack of report progress, and tasks' undesirability, making task distribution challenges. Lack of long-term planning. Management activities are not properly performed across the boundaries due to a lack of collaboration and communication. Lack of management commitment. \",\n",
       " \"Teamwork is based on team member relationships that facilitate the development of mutual respect and trust. This leads to the development of a cohesive motivated team that sees itself as a single unit regardless of its members’ location. The primary ingredients that impact the software development productivity of globally distributed projects are project delivery rate, team size, and communication complexity. The relationships of overseas team members should be formalized to share and accommodate secret requirements and build trust. Cooperation and competition within the teams to fulfill the goals. Collaborative systems incorporate norms of equality and emphasize group accomplishments. Team spirit is the feeling of satisfaction and honesty that coexists between the team members and motivates them to do well or be the best. Cross-functional teams. Each team member, representing a different knowledge specialty, comes to a team with a different thought world so that each member understands the problem, critical elements, and steps in solving the problem differently from each other. Effective task partitioning between team members and sites can be modularized, phased, or integrated. Task allocation. Allocation of the core team. Allocation of a whole team. An increased amount of effort with modifications involving several developers across different sites. Increased needs for coordination when using experts from different sites. Difficulties evaluating work input due to distribution. Difficulties in synchronizing tasks. Insufficient matching of code to available resources. Mutual coordination among team members is the interactions and relationships among participants that have become increasingly crucial for coordinating work and improving performance. Mutual understanding. knowledge creation ability among the teams. This shared understanding is the set of norms, behaviors, and understanding team members have about the assumptions, tasks, work processes, and contexts necessary for effective and successful collaboration. The common work experience is the site's experience working together. Degree of collaborative task coupling. Number of involved sites. Task site dependency. Collaborative coupling, in broad terms, signifies the intensity of user-user interaction to accomplish a task. Learning to work together, master the domain, and understand mutual sub-domains may take years. This fact may result in underestimating the learning curve in multi-site software development. Distributed members must be aware of the rules and regulations they must observe during the project, and a shared vision for the project can align team members toward shared goals.\",\n",
       " \"Emotional stability (i.e., calm, steady, self-confident, and secure), of the five major personality dimensions, conscientiousness, and emotional stability are the most valid predictors of performance outcomes across different occupations. Ability to solve their professional problems. The developer or a person proactively identifies and resolves potential problems with the proposed solution. Self-control is the personal aptitude and behavior to do work. Determination and effort. The effort reflects the effort exerted by the participant to complete the task, while exertion reflects the overall perception of strain caused by the task. The perceptual sensations represent three dimensions of perceived effort (sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective, and cognitive-evaluative dimensions). Accountability refers to the degree to which a person is liable and accountable for his/her acts and meets another person's expectations. It includes the extent to which a person seems to be reliable, consistent, self-confident, persistent, and responsible. Time management planning is a practice where people plan what they intend to accomplish and when on a given day. Creativity in problem-solving is capturing and getting inspired by external success stories. Individual analytical thinking is a personal soft skill where the developer has a high proficiency in a software programming language to build codes with complex instructions. Accepting criticism gracefully. Instill the values of good human relations and the need to work cooperatively, accept criticism gracefully, be courteous and enthusiastic, and maintain friendly relationships. Somehow, personal religion and political factors and behavior also relate to inter-culture as every country has its law, rules, and regulations to follow by the citizens. Benevolence is the willingness to help, availability, sharing, faith in intentions, friendliness, openness, caring, and commitment. Extroverted behaviors, for example, tend to result in a higher frequency of communication through electronic messages and increased team performance. Enhanced sensitivity predicts both reactivities to adverse contexts and the propensity to benefit from supportive resources from favorable environments. Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to regulate impulse control to engage in goal-directed behaviors. It measures elements such as control, inhibition, and persistence of behavior. Age is the number of years a person has lived. Lifelong learning is the individual behavior to develop competencies for performing the various roles required in human life and figuring out the learning skills by keeping the learning curve unrestricted. The degree of personal information. The degree of personal affective intensity. \",\n",
       " \"Organizational commitments. Employees feel compelled to reciprocate when offered valuable resources via social exchange and reciprocity mechanisms. Support, as it constitutes a socioemotional resource, leads employees to experience affective commitment toward the organization. Furthermore, organizational support may contribute to affective commitment by fulfilling basic socioemotional needs, such as affiliation, approval, and respect. Charismatic leadership. Experienced staff plays an essential role: a pre-start project briefing session; assigning inexperienced employees with experienced employees whenever possible; language training for long-term assignments if language is a crucial component; and briefings on payroll, pension, and tax aspects. Team rewards and recognitions. Team empowerment is defined as the collective belief in a group that it can be effective and its role in determining the group's effectiveness. Empowerment is the delegation of authority and decision-making responsibilities, strengthening the role of people and teams. Human resource practices should be selected that complement and support an organizational strategy. Capability to adopt team members. Contributing to discussions. Contribution to team effort. A team's effort contribution is the participation in helping each other, mutual support of team members, suggestions, and contribution of teams on project outcomes. Team members' attitudes express the satisfaction or dissatisfaction towards an individual, working environment, or event and an individual's behavior. The impact of attitudes influences communication in optimistic and pessimistic ways because of the individual's religious belief, personal attitudes, mindset, and knowledge. Communicate clearly with team members when speaking and writing. Participation and support to solve issues. Team members’ ability to assist in solving problems. The problem-solving ability or the inability to see the problem arises due to the uncooperative motivational attitude of higher-ranking management interacting with the team members at remote sites, resulting in a lack of team cohesiveness. Continuous organizational support. An organizational commitment can be triggered by a combination of three conditions: desire, compulsion, and obligation to work for the focal organization. Commitment provides a foundation for employees to engage in behaviors that support the organization. Employee facilitation includes individual initiatives, mentoring by a core team, and employee work-life balance. Also, work-life balance and the need for attractive packages for hiring. Persistent, conscientious responsiveness information of teams. Flexibility among teams. Adaptability is essential to organizational success due to environmental change. Brainstorming actions for organizations. \",\n",
       " \"Specialty ability of the teams. The gap in the teams' specialty ability would lead to some differences in performance. The practitioners with lower specialties might need more solid knowledge foundations (hard skills) and are comparatively weaker in thinking and learning abilities. Their self-confidence, motivation, and soft skills are insufficient. A total number of technical skills (one employee) comprise the following capabilities information technology, business domain, project management, and sourcing managing customers or suppliers. Team Skills Database. All global team members' technical capability and skill levels must be available to the Project Manager to facilitate effective global team operation. In addition, this information needs to be efficiently maintained, understood, and easily accessible. Skilled human resources are the type of skill or expertise of individuals available.  Reasoning skills. The ability to reason with emotions, or emotional reasoning skills, is the ability to employ emotional knowledge to understand and analyze emotions. Specifically, it includes capabilities such as understanding the links between emotion-eliciting situations and emotional reactions and describing one’s and others’ emotional experiences. The usage of a different language among distributed team members. In the current years, the English language has been widely used as a professional language at both national and international platforms. Team size refers to the number of people working together as a team to achieve certain goals. Proficiency in a programming language and expertise and knowledge in the application domain. Experience in similar projects. Staff experience on similar projects, programming language, and tool experiences. Communication skills in a second language. The prior experience measures the number of team programmers who have participated in at least one similar project. Therefore, the level of uncertainty is expected to decrease as the number of team members with relevant experience increases. We must base the selection of global team members on the project's technical requirements. Comprehension ability in a project context depends on information about the trustee’s roles and type of experience with technology use. Therefore, the personal profile also provides more data about skills and knowledge, such as previous work experience and academic studies. This information will allow the trustor to perceive a trustee’s capabilities rapidly and explicitly. Scrum expertise. Having previous experience in the roles, practices, processes, procedures, and artifacts in Scrum. Pilot knowledge between teams. \",\n",
       " 'Handling of data describes competence in the handling of data, also includes large data volumes and data security. Legislation and regulation with cloud provider. Data Aggregation is one of the critical challenges in the mining process; data searched, reported, and presented from a different source is vital to gain specific business objectives. Traceability of data is a key issue Working in a heterogeneous data environment. Data generated in real-time, i.e., online development systems, must check data assessment while sharing data in a continuous environment of DevOps during production, and proper tools are required to maintain continuous scalability and performance measures for better release. Data Harmonization. The increasing demand to integrate sizeable open data sets, ongoing updates, visualization, and analysis while addressing privacy and security concerns is a common problem. Storage of transition logs while considering data validity and security, storage of transition logs is a challenge in a DevOps environment. New visualization techniques and their assessments to implement or integrate new techniques Tools and technology: defect occurrence. Defect data contains knowledge about specific work conditions. A data feedback mechanism is required to prevent the reoccurrence of defects. Choose the right cloud service provider. Cloud computing is risky since there is no guarantee that the information is monitored or preserved by the service provider. In addition, the transition from local computing to cloud computing has created several security issues for the client and service provider. Efficient utilization of time and computing resources. Therefore, the scarcity of resources must be minimized to maintain adequate service, bypassing potential overloads. It is, therefore, essential to reduce the load on the server so that all users have equal performance. Misspelling in data entry. The development and operation teams working together in a DevOps environment may adopt best practices to resolve data entry issues avoiding misspellings in data entry. Missing information. The critical challenge in the DevOps environment is missing information and other invalid data due to integrating different sites in a software organization. Visualization of data it can be claimed that, without suitable visualization and understanding of large integrated data sets in a heterogeneous data environment, it is critical day by day to understand the purpose of data.

It involves proactively anticipating future needs and reacting to situations or risks that may arise during the contract execution. The involvement of top and lower-level management is essential to implement the Requirements change management process successfully. Besides, the participation and commitment of the management could be helpful for requirement elicitation and change management. Internal project communication, intrainformation, and interinformation sharing across distributed sites. Vision and mission of demanded changes, knowing the scope and purpose of change management is important for the successful implementation of the requested changes. Collaboration, communication, and coordination: cross-boundary. Process awareness. It is much important to held workshops and seminars to motivate the team members to participate in process awareness. Degree of Business Process maturity. If there are no stable requirements and requirement changes, this change must be communicated. This is not easily possible if there is no maturity or no good communication infrastructure between sites. In configuration management, the component version should easily track each component from start to final delivery. A different version of a product may have different sets and different versions of components, which need to be managed consistently and adequately for successful product integration. Potential differences in infrastructure across sites might lead to compatibility issues. Client and vendor organizational management commitment. Due to change frequently occurring in requirements during the system development process, organizational management must commit to and support change management activities. Therefore, upper, and lower management involvement is essential to implement the RCM process successfully. Resistance management of changing. The political environment influences the management effect of organizations on the requirements to change the management process because some organizations are hesitant to change the requirements. However, resistance management is essential in eliciting the desired requirements and effectively. Organization: strategies. Due to economic expansion, the sophistication of communication means, and cost pressure, it is crucial to comprehend the risks, challenges, opportunities, and good practices within this new software development scenario to construct business strategies.',\n",
       " 'Criticality of the task. Criticality is the importance of getting the task done correctly in terms of its adverse effects should problems occur, and a critical task is one where a failure impacts the life of a human. Complexity is a function of the number of interconnected variables in the task, and the most challenging tasks are those in which there is a constraint on decomposition into simpler subtasks. The degree of task formality description is the role of methodology to perform or explain professional services. The degree of task information, a content element of communication in service exchanges, is conveyed through functional duty terms. The proportion of task terms to the number of words in a message defines the degree of task information. Task Size. First, when creating tasks for user stories at the beginning of each iteration, limit the size of the tasks to 4 hours, 8 hours, or no more than 16 hours in length. Thus, this will ensure that the team can work more efficiently in a fully integrated way. Task efficiency is the completion of assigned or agreed-upon responsibilities is the critical behavior of completing assigned tasks in a timely and efficient manner. Task effectiveness is significant because the uncertainty on product and technological novelty requires more design and development tasks to be completed on time, avoiding the increasing lead time uncertainty. Defined roles and responsibilities are essential to assign the proper responsibility and task to the right person and time and should be clearly defined, articulated, and effectively disseminated for all team members. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities. Demonstrates initiative and responsibility for individual performance to get the job done under direct supervision. Coordination challenges level. Team coordination is defined as activities required to maintain consistency within a work product or to manage dependencies within the workflow. There are many different types of dependencies between task and task holders, these dependencies lead to a need for coordination among stakeholders working on a related set of tasks. When these coordination needs are not satisfied, they will have coordination challenges. Workload. As teams are distributed geographically and the communication among the distributed teams is less, tasks and responsibilities are not allocated properly. That may lead to a lack of shared understanding and confusion among the team members. ',\n",
       " \"Knowledge interchange rate is a process of exchange of explicit or tacit knowledge between two agents, during which one agent purposefully receives and uses the knowledge provided by another. When the knowledge's codifiability is higher, the knowledge can be easily transferred to knowledge recipients, and in some cases, employees need help finding updated knowledge transfer documents in their project repository, leading to delays in project delivery. Knowledge codifiability in an organizational project repository happens when complex knowledge is not codified in a high-level manner and is not straightforward to understand. The widespread use of the terms in the following list hint at the increased importance knowledge assets have in organizations: intellectual capital, knowledge capital, knowledge organizations, learning organizations, organizational learning, information age, knowledge era, information assets, intangible assets, intangible management, hidden value, and human capital. Knowledge-intensive business services, such as engineering, management consulting, and R&D, almost exclusively transfer knowledge and skills to client organizations. Absorptive capacity is the dynamic capacity that allows firms to create value and gain and sustain a competitive advantage by managing external knowledge. Understanding the process concerning knowledge transfer effectiveness on project outcome, also to ensure process improvement a common understanding of procedures should be established, process adherence should be ensured, and regular process audits should be conducted in all distributed sites. Learning of innovative technology is the participation, acceptance, and learning incentive of innovative technology in the global service climate. Tools and technology to facilitate knowledge transfer within the teams. The goal of these tools is to increase knowledge of the focal area to a high level of knowledge that allows for solving problems and innovation. To facilitate the interpretation and integration of the knowledge transfer process, we must create norms providing a standard frame of reference and definitions of key technical terms. The client ‘s knowledge loss becomes a problem of knowledge transfer when the company moves from an old vendor relationship to a new vendor relationship, as the client no longer holds all the information that the new vendor critically needs to involve in services with the client. While transferring knowledge from client location to offshore location, the knowledge transfer takes a long time and requires more iterations. It is difficult to measure how much cost it must invest for knowledge transfer. \",\n",
       " \"Software changes are inevitable due to the dynamic nature of the software development project itself. One factor influencing the effectiveness of the change acceptance decision is the accuracy of the change effort estimation. The identification of change is the key activity, which indicates why, how, and when change is needed.  The change acceptability refers to the quality of a software project dependent upon the satisfaction of the customers' needs and expectations. The impact analysis of a specific change request is important to estimate its effect on cost, time, and the quality of the system. The poor analysis of the scope of demanded changes could cause the poor estimation of time, cost, and effort that could bring the project towards failure. Degree of the novelty of the product for involved persons. Novelty increases the difficulties in a project. When the requirement is changed or is new, team members might be unaware of new requirements or team members might not understand the requirements completely. If the higher the novelty of project knowledge, the more difficult it is to transfer knowledge. Agile software development brings its own set of novel challenges that must be addressed to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software. The amount of working software produced determines progress in agile development. In addition, source code versioning, unit testing, continuous integration, and acceptance testing are technical factors that affect the software artifacts'. Continuous Integration is a software practice where developers frequently integrate, at least daily. Refactoring is constantly improving the design of existing code without modifying the fundamental behavior. In Agile software project, the modularization approach segregates the code base into domain modules, identifies well-defined interfaces to these modules, and restricts the inter-module interactions through these interfaces. A code smell is a term commonly used to describe potential problems in software design. Agile software developers focus on polymorphic designs that meet the project's long-term goals. These features of agile methods support the development of green and sustainable software. The software development team must know the data's status before using it in the deployment phase to make data more consistent since continuous deployment leads all importance towards the development of the process, which causes errors and inconsistency in data. \",\n",
       " \"Organization: structure. The organizational structure that has proven effective in practice is characterized by a flatter structure, decentralized decision-making, greater collaboration and coordination, faster knowledge transfer between employees, knowledge networking, teamwork, proactive approach, horizontal communication, flexibility, and agility. Organization: resource. The resource-based view of the firm indicates that the activities in which an enterprise engages consist of a bundle of resources which include assets, processes, attributes, knowledge, information, and know-how that a firm possesses and can therefore use to formulate and implement competitive strategies. Organization: standard. Standard in an organization is a behavioral approach like style (textual, formal); the organizational and operational environment; organization condition; usage context; knowledge type; requirement purpose; organization customs; type of product; and development process. Organizational Policy is mainly expressed as a particular behavior of a person, which includes intentional actions to effect specific decisions to safeguard their interests. Organizational Practices are the behaviors and actions of employees. Hence, are the employees' daily work habits aligned with the core values of organizational culture? Practices are one of the Five Ps (purpose, philosophy, priorities, practices, and projections) of an organization. Organization: regulations. The regulation describes any attempt to influence a population's behavior, whether, by law, force, nudging, or surreptitious manipulation. Organization: environment. The internal environment aspect can be observed using a functional approach consisting of production and operations, human resources, finance, management, and marketing information systems. The external environment is all circumstances outside the organization that has the potential to influence the organization. Stakeholder Attitude. In varying degrees, attitudes comprise three components, known to behavioral phycologists as the ABC Model of Attitudes Saul McLeod. The organizational size is defined as the number of employees at any given location, and this would include the entire corporate organization if it is in one geographical location or a division of a decentralized corporation. The organizational culture encompasses the employees' values, beliefs, and behaviors. The error management culture refers to the organization's culture of bargaining with errors. A productive culture of error is seen as a prerequisite for a successful digital transformation, especially during the transition phase. Culture of leadership. Employees desire good error management, forms of participation, and a culture of leadership that includes support and the establishment of common mindsets, stability, and reliability of corporate values. \",\n",
       " 'Architectural design practices are about implementing well-defined interfaces to increase modularization and aid loose coupling. Strive for high modularity and separation of concerns. Locate dependencies within architecture. The development, maintenance, and evolution of software architecture appear to be crucial, especially concerning the definition of interfaces. Lack of alignment between architectural decisions to organization structure and not reflecting architectural changes to an organization; challenges brought by misalignment between organization and architecture; challenges brought by personnel changes; difficulties ensuring compliance of modular design throughout the lifecycle and changes in an organization. Align architecture with organization arrangement, include business goals in design, base architectural decisions on available resources, and establish quality management practices. Conformance to share practices is the ignorance of or incorrect use of principles, rules, and guidelines for architectural design and knowledge management. Lack of stability in architecture leads to difficulties in applying design rules and dividing tasks. Inconsistent versioning. Insufficient interface specifications. Architecture-based task allocation identifies where the domain expertise lies and allocates tasks accordingly. Retain tightly coupled work items at one site. Acquire and arrange resources based on architecture. Establishing practices enhancing communication and knowledge distribution. Architects should handle communication with different stakeholders, considering stakeholders’ backgrounds. Communicate architectural artifacts and practices clearly to all sites. Maintain a single repository for architectural artifacts accessible to all. The standardized architectural practices ensure that teams develop code based on standard design agreements. Lack of continuous and active management of the architectures, including change control with a representation of all parties involved, is likely to lead to major problems, which appear to be detected only during the integration stage of the project. Compliance to processes. Impractical condensing of knowledge due to high dependency on one lead architect.  Assign responsibilities for prioritization, managing architectural work, and sharing knowledge to teams. Break work items into easily manageable pieces (consider one subsystem, can be handled by one person). Define clear responsibilities for the architecture team to handle changes that span through several components and/or sites. Insufficient knowledge management practices between projects and across the organization. Problems recognizing and caused by conflicting assumptions on software. Incorrect assumptions made during design. Unclear ownership of architectural elements. Architecting modeling techniques use (call) graphs/matrices to depict and detect coupling.

       " 'The stakeholder relationship is associated with customer feedback to improve development. Stakeholder involvement is essential for successful project delivery and is often considered a boundary activity or one that can be outsourced to business functions as usual. Nonetheless, project managers depend on people to respond to the outputs and benefits they deliver, and people will only respond if they are engaged. Understanding over the client’s business process environment. The knowledge of client language and culture. Gathering the information and experience among teams. Stakeholder: Client. The person paying the bill, or the initial paying customer can be seen to be the project client. Stakeholder: problem domain. Pushing knowledge beyond the constraints of the previous domain into new fields means that the boundaries of a theory receive more testing and support. Furthermore, these advances mean a greater understanding of when a theory works and why. Thus, the problem and solution domains are considered more mature. Communicate civility with team. In a team context, civility is acting with empathy, compassion, and kindness in every interaction and treating everyone connected online with dignity and respect. Communicate civility with stakeholders. In a stakeholder’s context, civility is acting with empathy, compassion, and kindness in every interaction and treating everyone connected online with dignity and respect. Stakeholder Performance Domain. This domain addresses activities (identifying, analyzing, prioritizing, engaging, and monitoring) and functions associated with stakeholders. Communicate clearly with stakeholders. Communicate clearly with stakeholders when speaking and writing to understand the direction of the stakeholders. Globally compete to market.

Social events include but are not limited to telling people what to do, spending time with sharp and witty people, giving speeches, attending parties, laughing without reservation, voicing strong personal values and opinions in a group, telling jokes, criticizing someone, and asking for help or advice. Communality refers to the personal characteristics that the trustor has in common with the trustee, like a similar goal they wish to achieve, shared language use, common identity characteristics, or shared values. It is a personal technical dimension. Collaborative work friendly is the ability to function on multidisciplinary teams. In today’s multicultural world, this outcome also implies an ability to collaborate with people from different cultures, abilities, and backgrounds. Internalized norms are integrity, discretion, honesty, fairness, and loyalty. This criterion refers to the intrinsic moral norms a trustee uses to guard his/her actions. The language Analysis regarding how a trustee uses the chat and walls could infer some people’s values. Communication protocols and customs. A communication Protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities in a communications system to transmit information via any variation of a physical quantity. Communication protocols are formal descriptions of formats and rules for producing digital messages for electronic data exchange. Climatic condition.

For example, women are far more prevalent in software quality assurance than in other software subspecialties. Work-Life Balance Issues (Women). After the COVID-19 pandemic and suddenly working from home, women reported being pressured to work overtime, with no working hours limits, and having to attend meetings in different time zones or learn new knowledge. Thus, they would be excluded from decisions made in meetings and perceived by others as lacking in teamwork. Benevolent Sexism (Women) represents the subjectively positive feelings towards gender that often bring some sexist antipathy. Lack of Recognition (women). Feeling valued or appreciated is part of Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. The woman mentioned not being recognized for her work and that the women's results are usually evaluated as OK, never as excellent, even when they perform exceptional work. Lack of Peer Parity (Women). Being surrounded by similar individuals to which to compare oneself or identifying with at least one other peer in the team, is known as peer parity. Impostor phenomenon (Women) or Syndrome describes an experience of individuals who, despite their objective successes, feel persistent self-doubt and are exposed as fraud or impostor. The women mentioned it as a challenge and reason to leave situations in which women personalize failures and feel ashamed and inferior more than men, and they tend to escape the job, but always masked as personal reasons. Pay inequality between genders (Women) and inferior career growth opportunities. Men raise only their counterparts to the top layer. Lack of transparency about the laddering criteria. Prove-it Again (Women) is a bias effect that occurs when a group member who does not align with the stereotypes is measured by a stricter criterion than those who align with them. So, for example, women always need to show competence: put extra effort to be heard when there is competition between men and have no room to slip[up]. Maternal Wall (Women) expresses the experience of mothers whose coworkers perceive and judge them as having made one of two choices: either they continue to work and neglect their family, making the motherless likable, or the mother prioritizes family over work, making them less reliable in the workplace.\",\n",

First, Company Mission by supplying products that satisfy customer needs considering all the lifecycle impacts. Then Vision, when the company coordinates the generation, change, and storage of all the relative product metadata with metrics that will assess the sustainability of all the product lifecycle phases. Finally, the Objective is to share data, information, and knowledge of all the product lifecycle stages, to encourage collaboration with all stakeholders, and enable sustainability through Green Products and Processes. Reuse ability. The application of reusable requirements catalogs to the development of software products implies changes in the basic Requirements Engineering process model (elicitation, analysis and negotiation, documentation or specification, and validation). The differences between the reuse-based and general process models are mild but may still lead to some process overload. Limited support for reusability. Usability consists of how users' features affect the use of an interactive system in the work environment. So, software reusability is an attribute that refers to the expected reuse potential of a software component. Minimal reengineering. Reengineering systems on a microservices-based architecture can be seen as implementing a service-oriented architecture (SOA). However, deploying SOA in a company is demanding, as it may implicate updating mission-critical systems with high technical debt and maintenance costs. Thus, a process is required that supplies a fine set of stages and techniques that minimize risks and simultaneously ensure the quality of the systems during the migration process. Software reuse not only improves productivity but also positively impacts the quality and maintainability of software products. E-waste minimization. The electronics industry is the largest and most innovative industry in the world. However, after a time of use, it becomes a complex residue. It contains many hazardous heavy metals, acids, toxic chemicals, and non-degradable plastics. Interfacing with different layers of development framework. If an application must maintain persistent data, a mechanism for allowing it is required. CRUD pattern could be used to maintain a database and manage the life cycle of creating, updating, deleting, and reading data. In addition, it is essential for modeling related entity classes.

       " 'Data integration, this request for integration implies that all the development artifacts in software processing are constantly accessible, even if they reside across different development tools. A clear integration plan is necessary to ensure efficiency and without extra complexity when finally putting the system together. Thus, integration asks for a centrally controlled approach. Similar programming languages. In GSD, many software components are not properly integrated due to the heterogeneity of software programming languages, operating systems, and communication tools. In addition, a common infrastructure is not shared between sites, making integrating components developed on these sites complex. In incremental integration, pieces of software are integrated into increments to avoid extensive integration. Thus, if we set an initial stage for the integration of components, while some components may still be in the development stage, it may be more valuable and save precious time during later stages of integration. Component or Unit Testing prior to integration. If the distributed teams submit their developed components to the central team without proper component or unit tests, the integration phase will reveal many problems delaying the whole development process and fixing one problem may introduce another problem. The specific integration timing in the integration phase, or the synchronizing of the various parts, is one of the most challenging phases of software projects in the GSD environment. Software testing methods. Components are delivered untested due to pressure caused by time constraints on the development teams. They should be properly unit tested before integrating them into the final system as they are developed for some specific use cases. In almost 80% of the projects, integrator finds defects during integration due to improper unit testing. Proper documentation. The root cause of most integration problems is inadequate documentation. Many projects documentation is hard for the client organization because most of the knowledge concentrates and remains hidden in the vendor organization. In some cases, even if the documentation exists, it is obsolete and plays no role other than introducing new people to the coarse grain. Compatibility of data. Lack of compatibility. The GSD teams may use diverse platforms and tools for the development of software components or subsystems. These components/subsystems raise compatibility problems during integration. ',\n",
       " 'Trust building. Personal or impersonal, including cognitive trust, which refers to beliefs about others’ competence and reliability. This can lead individuals to engage in less self-protective actions and be more likely to take risks. Trust among team members is the confidence of development team members. The ability to motivate others and create trust happens when a person can motivate and inspires; builds potential in others; creates an environment that fosters learning, collaboration, and fluid teamwork, and attracts high performers. Trust: confidence in the company and leadership and other stakeholders. The mere act of mingling with employees promotes the concept of the leader as just another colleague. During that interaction, if employees feel confident expressing a personal concern or need, presumably due to preexisting trust, the leader should act on that to further reinforce trust and demonstrate care and respect. If the leader acts reasonably, trust and confidence in the leader will increase. Trust: cross-boundary. Trust building is a critical factor for developing cross-boundary information sharing and, in a much broader sense, is a crucial element of the social capital needed for any successful cooperation or collaboration within and across social networks. Mediating role knowledge transfer. Strong ties are effective in providing valuable knowledge. Such relationships are helpful because they tend to be trusting. The benevolence and competence-based trust mediate the link between strong ties and the receipt of helpful knowledge. Eminence Education is reserved for individuals with fully developed talents who are incredibly talented in a domain relative to other highly accomplished producers and performers. This relative superiority is recognized by senior members of the domain and is usually related to sustained contributions or contributions that have had or will have a lasting and memorable impact on the domain.

The standards and procedures guide the practitioners about what to do and how to do it. Process ownership. Process ownership is defined as placing ownership with those closest to the process who experience bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Process owners are responsible for getting the work done by workers, designing it, and ensuring the execution and high performance of the process in different organizational units. Software Process improvement - Consultancy. The consultancy in software process improvement is the capability of the consultants, based on their experience, to help small and medium Web companies adopt formal software process improvement standards while remaining aligned with the Web company’s vision. Process improvement evaluation. Most process improvement evaluation strategies are generic, and different organizations apply those methods for measuring success indicators based on organizational needs and contexts, indicating a shortcoming in the methods used and supporting the demand for a comprehensive measurement framework. Process improvement standards and procedures. Process improvement standards and procedures: a set of policies and standard procedures describing how the firm's processes will be conducted and maintained consistently. Uniform processes. Lack of uniform process between different development sites. Best practices are to organize process-based training for new employees; ensure that management-level workshops synchronize global processes; follow standard processes and tools; follow a single process with all teams; follow documentation standards; adopt process evaluation standards and establish process training programs in the organization.

Scrum is the most widely applied Agile methodology and is a process framework for delivering products and services of the highest possible quality and handling complex problems or situations. Iterative and incremental approaches are used to develop products using cross-functional teams. Number os sprints. The number of sprints is short work cycles for incremental development. Scaling tools and standards. Beyond regular global projects, agile scaling involves many challenges, including coordination among multiple agile teams and the need for an initial architecture and requirement analysis. Several frameworks for scaling agile software development have been suggested, such as the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Disciplined Agile Delivery, Large-Scale Scrum, Nexus, and Scrum@Scale. Training of DevOps activities. Training in DevOps activities has a positive impact while implementing DevOps. Formal training sessions are required to understand the concept and DevOps environment properly. The organization must support its teams with training sessions to help their organization successfully work on DevOps activities.',\n",
       " 'Proper component interfaces. Lack of proper component interfaces is the interface through which a component requests services or provides services. Inconsistencies between components/modules create problems during the integration stage. Component dependency. Software component dependencies in a product architecture give rise to communication and coordination needs. The architectural mechanisms other than module or software component dependencies also create coordination requirements. The software component dependencies must be addressed before allocating to temporally distant sites can be taken. Interface Compatibility. In software development, different components in a product interact and integrate through well-defined interfaces. Through interfaces, the component avails and provides services. Therefore, the software developer should develop in-house components or select COTS components that are loosely coupled and have well-defined software interfaces to fit into the final product easily. Components evaluation. Almost all types and sizes of software are composed of more than one software component, or module developed in-house or outsourced. Similarly, in components evaluation, the components may be purchased from the market as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) component or from the large pole of the open-source community as an off-the-shelf (OTS) component. Product size. The product size to be developed comprise program code, an integral component of the software; architectural design size:  components, their functions, and their interactions (interfaces); and specification size like the Unified Modeling Language. Identifying dependencies on architectural design decision. Identifying dependencies on architectural design decisions, insufficient decoupling, or cross-component features are challenges brought about by software complexity and difficulties defining logical entities and finding interface boundaries in architecture. Product selection and customization (off the shelf). Due to time and budget constraints, it is challenging to select a proper component and customization from a large pool of components. Furthermore, in the case of open-source software (OSS), there are problems in the selection, maintenance, integration, and licensing of OTS (off-the-shelf) components. ',\n",

Performance tests are performed to ensure that software changes do not affect application performance. A retrofit test is about incorporating changes already made to production code in parallel by other project teams. Metrics to assess risk-based testing. Metrics to assess risk-based testing is to assess how many risks we mitigated through risk test cases. In addition, it allows checking how many risks we mitigated per requirement. Finally, identifying prioritized risks allows us to confirm prioritized risks with the highest level of requirements. Metrics to assess risk-based testing activities (time). Metrics to assess risk-based testing time identification allows knowing the average time taken to analyze a requirement with a certain number of lines. Assessing risk identification activity allows setting useful or meaningful risks to develop test cases. Automated metrics allow for to definition of code complexity metrics. Semi-automated metrics allow us to measure functional complexity, for example. Finally, manual metrics allow the frequency of use and the importance for the user. Code coverage concepts and tools. Code coverage measures the degree to which a test suite exercises a software system. Software testing is often used to determine and sometimes improve software quality. However, it is also very labor, and resource-intensive process that often accounts for more than 50% of the total cost of software development. ',\n",
